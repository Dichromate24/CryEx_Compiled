This project is part of a undergraduate research project (ZB3288).

Comparative Analysis of Cryptic Splicing Detection Tools
Cryptic Splicing Detection and Transcriptomic Analysis

This project leverages RNA-seq data to understand the impact of hnRNPM knockdown on splicing patterns.
Two cryptic splicing detection pipelines (SpliCeAT and CryEx) were implemented and optimized for the detection and quantification of cryptic splicing eventse to assemble augmented transcriptomes.

The original SpliCeAT code can be found in https://github.com/GTK-lab/SpliCeAT/tree/main
The differential transcript expression and Gene ontology analysis, along with the Gviz plots are listed above

The code used to replicate CryEx can be found under CryEx_Code
